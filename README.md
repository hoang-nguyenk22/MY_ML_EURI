## General
Machine learning has been rapidly evolving in recent years, with a dramatic increase in a variety of models in various fields, ranging from finance and healthcare to customer and autonomous systems, even into the field of biology. As the number of models continues to grow and evolve, however, selecting the most appropriate model for a given task can be difficult. In this project, we explore four prominent machine learning models, Decision Tree, Neural Network, Naive Bayes, and Genetic Algorithm, through implementations, evaluations, and comparisons in terms of performance to determine the most effective model for a given problem. The central objective of our project is to evaluate and compare the performance of these models on a common dataset to analyze how they handle classification tasks under various conditions and settings, then provide a comprehensive understanding of their strengths, limitations, and suitability for a specific task. We will also explore their behavior with respect to accuracy, computational efficiency, interpretability, and robustness.

### Decision trees

### Neural networks

### Naive Bayes

### Genetic Algorithms
Phase 1 : Implementation of a genetic algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to find the best combination of hyperparameters (e.g., number of filters, dense units, learning rate, batch size) that maximizes the validation accuracy of the CNN.
